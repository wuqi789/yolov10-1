![Version 11: Deploy Tab Inference](https://i.imgur.com/eVRmfw9.gif)
* the demo video was prepared from the [Deploy Tab](https://blog.roboflow.com/deploy-tab), and utilizes `v11` (`YOLOv8n-100epochs`)

The dataset includes an aggregation of [images cloned](https://blog.roboflow.com/use-open-source-computer-vision-datasets/) from the following datasets:
1. https://universe.roboflow.com/brad-dwyer/egohands-public/ - null images
2. https://universe.roboflow.com/presentations/rock-paper-scissors-presentation/
3. https://universe.roboflow.com/team-roboflow/rock-paper-scissors-detection
4. universe.roboflow.com/popular-benchmarks/mit-indoor-scene-recognition/

New images were added to the dataset and labeled to supplement the examples from the cloned datasets. Members of Team Roboflow, and more close friends of the team, are included in the dataset to assist with creating a more robust, generalized, model.
